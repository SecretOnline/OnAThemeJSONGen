        <h2>On A Theme JSON Generator</h2>
          <p>Making texture variations in Minecraft is annoying. It's a lot of tedious work, which includes copying and pasting files, only to edit a couple of things, then repeat it.</p>
          <p>I made this to make that process a little easier. The JSON generator handles a lot of this for you, with plans to be able to do a most of the process for you.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="usage">
          <h3>Usage</h3>
          <p>Upon opening the program, it should look something like the screenshot below:</p>
          <img src="1.png" alt="The program, as seen when first opened.">
          <p>To add and remove block from the pack, you need to use the "Blocks" menu. Click the option to add a new block.</p>
          <img src="2.png" alt="The Blocks menu.">
          <p>A new window will pop up, and will ask for a block name. For this example, I'm going to use a rose bush. As you can see, I've filled in <code>crafting_table</code> as the Block Name. This <em>must</em> be the name that is used by the game. Once you've done that, click "Add" to add a variant of this block.</p>
          <img src="3.png" alt="Creating a block.">
          <p>Yet another window will appear. Looks complicated, I know. Don't worry, it's not that bad. </p>
          <img src="4.png" alt="Variant addition window.">
          <p>Fill in the top textboxes. Since the crafting table is based off the <code>cube</code> mode, I've specified that as the parent. I'm also going to overwrite the model names to say <code>crafting_table</code>, otherwise they will be created as <code>cube></code>, and if you're not careful you may end up with some conflicts.</p>
          <img src="5.png" alt="Defining the model to use.">
          <p>Now we need to make the textures.</p>
          <p>In the "Texture" textbox I've typed <code>crafting_table_top</code>. Click "Add Texture".</p>
          <img src="6.png" alt="Setting the texture for a face.">
          <p>Now we need to set the reference. This is the string that the game uses to put the texture onto the right face of the model. In this case, we want <code>up</code>. Click "Add Reference".</p>
          <img src="7.png" alt="Adding a face reference.">
          <p>Since that's al we want for this face, click "Add Texture Group". It should now look like the screenshot below.</p>
          <img src="8.png" alt="Texture Group added.">
          <p>You don't have to specify one texture per face, or only one face per texture. If you give it more, it will go through and create variations for all of the possible combinations.</p>
          <p>Here I've given the 4 sides of the block the option of the "front" or the "side" textures. This will create every combination, from every side being "front", to every side being "side, and everything inbetween.</p>
          <img src="9.png" alt="Specifying more than one of eact item.">
          <p>When added as a Texture Group, only the first items are displayed in the text. The rest are hidden behind a number.</p>
          <img src="10.png" alt="Viewing the texture groups in the listbox.">
          <p>Now all we need to do is create that Block Variant.</p>
          <img src="11.png" alt="Creating the Block Variant.">
          <p>You will now see the "normal" variant in this listbox. As we didn't specify a variant name, it defaulted to "normal". Click "Create Block".</p>
          <img src="12.png" alt="Reviewing the variants.">
          <p>By navigating through the listboxes, you can update the rotations of the block. As more features are added, more options will be available. Be sure to click "Update Rotations", otherwise your changes will not be used.</p>
          <img src="13.png" alt="Updating rotations.">
          <p>The final thing to do is create the files. In the file menu, click "Create UnZipped". This will create a new folder called <code>OaT</code> in the same directory as the .exe for this program. Inside will be all of the model and blockstate files.</p>
          <img src="14.png" alt="Creating model and blockstate files.">

          Should you wish to improve the program, the source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/SecretOnline/OnAThemeJSONGen">GitHub</a>. Thanks for trying it out, and thank you <em>very</em> much for actually bothering to read the instructions.
