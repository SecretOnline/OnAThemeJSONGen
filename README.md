OnAThemeJSONGen
---

JSON variant generator for Minecraft.  
Originally created to be used with my pack: [On a Theme](http://secreonline.co/minecraft/textures/onatheme).

Instructions: [github.io](http://git.secretonline.co/OnAThemeJSONGen)

To Do:
---

1. Tidy it up. (It needs serious cleaning. I'm sure there's a far better way to do a lot of this.)
2. Attributes system. (e.g. "half=upper" and hopefully be able to handle things such as "alt=false,east=false,flip=false,north=false,south=false,upper=0,west=false". The fire file is massive.
3. Add more model types, hopefully being able to support every block in the game.
4. More customizability.
